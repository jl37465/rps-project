# rps-project
Rock Paper Scissors Project with JavaScript

NOTE: For learning purposes, the program has been built within the <script> tag inside of the HTML document instead of in an external file. Additional functionality, including a GUI, will be implemented at a later date. Also, the main play function has simply been called five times instead of using loops.
