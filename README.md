Rock Paper Scissors Project with JavaScript

This was the second project in The Odin Project's Curriculum under "Fundamentals". It involved repurposing an existing project (Rock Paper Scissors in pure HTML) and improving the code to make use of a GUI via JavaScript. Currently, this web page allows the user to press one of three buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and then compares than input with a randomly generated computer value. If the user "wins", the display changes to show a "winning" message and increment's their score, instead displaying a "losing" message and incrementing the computer's score if the computer wins. It also displays a "tie" message and does not change the score in the event of a tie. Once one side reaches 5 points, a "Game Over" message is displayed and prompts the user to press any button in order to reset the score and start over. Once any button is pressed, all buttons return to their original functionality and the game may progress once more as normal.


~~ MAIN AIMS ~~
The main aims of this project were to demonstrate fundamental JavaScript skills in a more practical scenario. Instead of simply printing to the console, I had to develop an HTML+CSS web page and GUI, with which the JavaScript code would then interact through means such as DOM manipulation. This was also my first time using Git's branch features to emulate the idea of creating separate branches to test certain experimental features, before merging these back into the main branch once I was finished. It also allowed me to experience some code refactoring from pure HTML to JavaScript, although I was also adding new functionality on top of that.


~~ CHALLENGES ~~
While the logic itself had already been completed for the most part, translating that logic from pure HTML into JavaScript was quite time-consuming, especially when factoring in the added button functionality, which would change according to the user's progression in the game. Certain aspects like variable management and DOM manipulation took longer to grasp, but eventually I was able to get them working as planned after some reviews of certain methods.


~~ IMPROVEMENTS ~~
Much like my previous project, the responsiveness of the web page to different viewport sizes and devices leaves much to be desired. However, as this was not the main focus of the project, I do not think that it hindered the funcionality or project aims in any way.
